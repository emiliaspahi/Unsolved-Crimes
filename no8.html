                <h1>Oslo Plaza Woman</h1>

                <p class="lead py-3">A woman in her mid-20s registered at the Oslo Plaza Hotel on May 31, 1995, as <bold>‘Jennifer Fairgate’</bold>. She didn’t provide a credit card, so a security guard knocked on her door days later to get one. He heard a loud noise and left to get the head of security. Within 15 minutes her dead body was discovered with a bullet to the forehead. There was no blood on her hands, however. Her name was an alias. She had no ID and her clothing tags were missing. There was no hairbrush, toothbrush, or toiletries to gather DNA evidence, and the registration number was removed from the gun with acid. Oslo Police said they were 99.9 percent certain the death was a suicide and closed the case in 1996. Ola Kaldager, a Norwegian intelligence officer, believes Oslo Plaza Woman was likely a secret agent who was tracked down and executed. </p>

                <h1>Trouble in Tucson</h1>

                <p class="lead py-3">Charles Morgan was a Tucson, Arizona escrow agent who once worked with the mafia transferring cash into gold bullion. <bold>Morgan testified in a secret state investigation</bold> into Banco Internacional de Arizona and disappeared afterward in 1977. His body was found on a dirt road with a bullet to the back of his head. He was shot with his own gun, which had no fingerprints. In his car nearby, police found ammunition, several sets of handcuffs, and one of his teeth in tissue paper. A $2 bill, a map, and directions to the murder site were pinned to his underwear. Seven Spanish names were written on the $2 bill plus a <bold>Bible citation â€“ Ecclesiastes 12:1-8</bold>. Authorities ruled the death a suicide.</p>

                <h1>The Ice Valley mystery</h1>

                <p class="lead py-3">Norway’s ‘Isdal woman’ case reads like a Cold War Scandi thriller. A woman’s burned body was found in the remote Ice Valley in 1970. Nearby lay a bottle of St. Hallvard liqueur, jewelry, and clothing with the labels ripped out. Days later, at a railway station, two suitcases were found packed with wigs, maps, timetables, and British, Swiss, Belgian, and Norwegian currency. A partial fingerprint on a pair of sunglasses matched the body. Police interviewed Hotel Hordaheimen staff about a guest who kept to herself, appeared guarded, and paid cash. Her coded notepads revealed dates and locations, allowing police to determine she used eight fake passports. Authorities ruled the death as a suicide from a sleeping pill overdose. The victim, known only as <bold>Isdal woman</bold>, has never been identified.</p>

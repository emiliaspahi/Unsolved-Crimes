                <h1>MI6 mystery</h1>

                <p class="lead py-3">Britain’s ‘spy in a bag’ case has captivated the nation since Gareth Williams was found in his London apartment in 2010. Police discovered Williams’ naked, decomposing body in a sports bag placed in the bathtub. The holdall was padlocked but the key was inside. Had Williams somehow locked himself in? Williams dabbled in bondage but even Houdini would struggle to get into a locked sports bag. Police found no signs of forced entry to the apartment yet they <bold>removed and replaced</bold> his front door. William’s phone was returned to its factory settings in the hours surrounding his death. Although the intelligence analyst hadn’t shown up for work for five days, MI6 didn’t report him missing for a week. The police said it was probably an accident. The coroner said it was likely criminal.</p>

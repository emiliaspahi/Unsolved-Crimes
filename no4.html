                <h1>Canada’s mansion mystery</h1>

                <p class="lead py-3">Ada Maria Redpath and her five children were a wealthy Montreal family, heirs to the Redpath sugar fortune. They lived a charmed life until 1901 when a family member found <bold>Ada shot dead in her bedroom</bold>. Her 24-year-old son, Cliff, lay dying nearby. The coroner decided Cliff suffered temporary insanity from an epileptic fit, killed his mother, then turned the gun on himself. Canadians have puzzled over the details for more than a century, however. Doctors and staff recalled two revolvers at the scene. Was a third person involved? And why had none of the servants helped or called the police? Investigators didn’t visit the house until one day after Ada’s death. Why the delay? Within 48 hours of the shootings, both mother and son were buried, leaving many to wonder about the hasty preparations. Ada, 59, a widow, left a fortune valued at about $5m in today’s money.</p>

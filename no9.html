                <h1>Ghost ship</h1>

                <p class="lead py-3">The Mary Celeste <bold>is a nautical mystery</bold> that has haunted the generations. The American merchant ship was found adrift east of Portugal’s Azores in 1872 with the belongings of the eight crewmen still in their quarters. The crew was missing, however, along with the lifeboat. There was water in the bottom of the ship but it didn’t appear to be overly threatening. Theories have ranged from mutiny to pirates, but the cargo of 1,700 barrels of industrial alcohol was largely intact along with a six-month supply of food and water. An experienced captain, Benjamin S. Briggs, his wife, daughter, and a crew of eight were never heard from again. Sir Arthur Conan Doyle - Sherlock Holmes’ creator - revived interest in the ghost ship with his <bold>short story</bold>, and both a <bold>documentary</bold> and a <bold>film</bold> later examined the evidence, but no one has ever unraveled the mystery of the Mary Celeste. </p>

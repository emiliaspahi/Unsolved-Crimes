                <h1>YOG’TZE</h1>

                <p class="lead py-3">In October 1984, at about 11 pm, German food engineer Günther Stoll stood up saying: “I’ve got it!” His wife said Stoll then wrote YOG’TZE on a piece of paper, crossed it out, then went to the pub. Stoll ordered a beer, fell to the ground, injured his head, and lost consciousness. He’d been in a paranoid state of mind all evening, but wasn’t drunk. At about 3 am, seeing Stoll’s car crashed on the roadside, two truck drivers pulled over and found him naked in the passenger’s seat. <bold>Stoll mentioned four men</bold> before dying en route to the hospital. Investigators discovered Stoll was injured before the crash and must have been placed in the car naked, with leaves and dirt still clinging to his body. The world YOG’TZE doesn’t exist, and it is unclear if Stoll wrote YO6'TZE with a ‘6’ - said to be a Romanian radio signal - or if YOG’ meant a yogurt called TZE. German police still get calls about the cipher’s possible meaning. The cold case has not been solved. </p>

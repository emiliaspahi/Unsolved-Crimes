                <h1>Missouri’s cryptic murder</h1>

                <p class="lead py-3">Ricky McCormick's murder in St. Louis, Missouri remains one of the FBI’s top unsolved cases. McCormick’s body was dumped in a field in 1999 with two encrypted notes found in his trouser pockets. Despite help from the American Cryptogram Association, the FBI has not been able to decipher the codes. “We are really good at what we do,” the FBI’s Dan Olson said in a statement, “but we could use some help with this one.” The code might reveal McCormick’s whereabouts before his death and lead to the killer. Olson’s plea also outlined <bold>how the FBI’s cryptanalysts solve codes and ciphers</bold> in four stages. </p>

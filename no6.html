                <h1>New Hampshire intrigue</h1>

                <p class="lead py-3">Back in August 1918, WWI had just ended and gentleman farmer William K. Dean was found in a cistern with his hands bound, burlap bags over his head, and a 20-pound stone attached to his body. His wife said Dean, a retired doctor, went out to milk the cows and never came back. Police didn’t think Mrs. Dean was physically capable of the murder so their attention turned to Charles Rich, a judge and banker, who had visited on the day of Dean’s death. Rich sported a black eye the next morning but said he’d been kicked by a horse and visited the doctor for treatment. Rumors swirled that <bold>a German spy was renting a property on Dean’s farm</bold> and flashing signal lights from the hilltop, coded messages for his spy ring. Something was amiss. On the day he died, Dean asked a neighbor heading to Boston to tell the police he had information for them. The murderer was never caught. </p>
